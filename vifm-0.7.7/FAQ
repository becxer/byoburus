Q: Vifm doesn't run executables, what's wrong with it?

A: Nothing.  Just set 'runexec' option on.  It's off by default.

Q: How can I use SSH with vifm?

A: Follow this steps:
   1) Download and install sshfs
   2) Register an extension that will be used for connections over SSH.
      The format is:
      :filetype extensions FUSE_MOUNT2|some_mount_command using %PARAM and %DESTINATION_DIR variables

      A sample line might look like this:
      :filetype *.ssh FUSE_MOUNT2|sshfs %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR

      %PARAM and %DESTINATION_DIR are filled in by vifm at runtime.
      %PARAM value is filled from the first line of file (whole line).

      You can also add %CLEAR if you want to clear screen before running FUSE
      program.
   3) Create a file with ssh extension that contain connection parameters in the
      first line.  A sample first line could be:
      root@127.0.0.1:/

Q: How can one access FTP with vifm?

A: Since vifm tries to adhere to the Unix philosophy VFS (Virtual File System)
probably will not be added.  To access FTP on a Unix-like system use FUSE file
system (see curlftpfs project at http://curlftpfs.sourceforge.net).  FUSE isn't
implemented for Windows, so Windows users should use one of programs that bind
FTP connections to file system (for example FTPDrive at
http://www.killprog.com/fdrve.html).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How can I customize vifm?

A: There are several ways to do that:

  - using vifmrc file (it's in ~/.vifm/)
    This file can contain any of vifm commands.  You probably would like too set
    mappings and options here.  vifm will never change this file (it's something
    similar too ~/.vimrc).

  - changing color scheme (~/.vifm/colorschemes)
    You can set change colors of different TUI elements of vifm here. Or add
    completely new color schemes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: What operations can be undone/redone?

A: List of currently supported operations:
  - rename
  - move
  - copy
  - delete (when using Trash)
  - permissions change (chmod)
  - owner change
  - group change
  - chmod
  - creating symbolic links with absolute paths
  - creating symbolic links with relative paths
  - creating of directories

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How can one execute vifm commands after using :! ?

A: The only way to do this is using :execute command.  Example:
  :execute ":!shell command" | vifm command

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Is there a way to copy/paste without sending to trash first?

A: Yes, to do that, one should yank (copy) files as usual, but use "P" key (not
"p") to put (paste) them into current directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: vifm expands macros in a wrong way in user defined commands with vifm's
   commands (like in `:command com :mkdir ~/tmp/%c:e | cd ~/tmp/%c:e`).  What to
   do to fix it?

A: Just double percent sign (%%).  Why?  Because user commands containing
   vifm's command-line commands are parsed twice.  First time to replace %a
   macro, and second time during command execution.  So doubled percent sign
   will be parsed with single % during first parse and a %x macro will be
   expanded during second parse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: vifm expands range in a wrong way in user defined commands (like in
   `:command com :%yank`) and shows "Invalid command name" message.  What to
   do to fix it?

A: See answer for the previous question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How to browse FTP in vifm?

A: Use CurlFTPFS FUSE filesystem on *nix, which you can find here:
     http://curlftpfs.sourceforge.net/
   And on Windows you need to use FTPDrive, which will mount a FTP remote as
   a drive for you. Get it here:
     http://www.killprog.com/fdrve.html

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How can I help vifm?

A: Just use it and report any problems, bugs or suggestions to its developers by
   email or trackers.  You also can send you configuration and colorscheme files
   to developers.  They can be collected and published at site of vifm.
   Examples of configuration files can also show developers of vifm how users
   typically uses vifm, so they can improve support of the most common use
   cases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How to make shell aliases and functions work in vifm when running them like
   ":!foo"?

A: Here is solution for bash, other shells should allow to do something similar.

   1. Add the following lines to ~/.bashrc

       shopt -s expand_aliases
       unset BASH_ENV

   2. Add the following line to ~/.vifm/vifmrc

       let $BASH_ENV='~/.bashrc'

   After following the steps above aliases and functions should work the same
   way as if they were typed in interactive shell by user.  But they won't be
   completed with <tab> completion.
